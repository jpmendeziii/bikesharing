# Bikesharing
## Utilizing Tableau to analyze Citi Bike data for a potential startup in Des Moines, Iowa.
For this analysis, you’ll use Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, using the converted datatype, you’ll create a set of visualizations to:

Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week. Finally, you’ll add these new visualizations to the two you created in this module for your final presentation and analysis to pitch to investors.

* Deliverable 1: Change Trip Duration to a Datetime Format
* Deliverable 2: Create Visualizations for the Trip Analysis
* Deliverable 3: Create a Story and Report for the Final Presentation
## Deliverable 1
Deliverable Requirements:
Using Python and Pandas functions, you’ll convert the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype to get the time in hours, minutes, and seconds (00:00:00). After you convert the "tripduration" column to a datetime dataytpe, you’ll export the DataFrame as a CSV file to use for the trip analysis in Deliverable 2.

## Deliverable 2
### Create Visualizations for the Trip Analysis
Deliverable Requirements:
Using Tableau, create visualizations that show:

* How long bikes are checked out for all riders and genders.
* How many trips are taken by the hour for each day of the week, for all riders and genders.
* A breakdown of what days of the week a user might be more likely to check out a bike, by type of user and gender.
* Create the Checkout Times for Users Viz
* In this visualization, you’ll graph the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders.

1. In the visualization below, there is a line graph displaying the number of bikes checked out by duration for all users, and the graph can be filtered by the hour.
